10. .Write a C++ class Seller (S Name, Product_name, Sales Quantity, Target Quantity, Month. 
Commission). Each salesman deals with a separate product and is assigned a target for a month. 
At the end of the month his monthly sales is compared with target and commission iscalculated 
as follows: If Sales Quantity>Target Quantity then commission is 25% of extra sales made+ 10% 
of target. If Sales Quantity Target Quantity then commission is 10% of target. Otherwise 
commission is zero. Display salesman information along with commission obtained. (Use array 
of objects).

information by calculating charges. (Rules to calculate electricity board charges)  For first 100 
units Rs. 1 per unit  For next 200 units: Rs. 2 per unit  Beyond 300 units : Rs. 5 per unit All 
users are charged a minimum of Rs.150. If the total charge is more than Rs.250.00 then an 
additional charge of 15% is added.
